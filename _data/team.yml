    Yurou He is a Ph.D. student at the Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management. She studies the impacts 
    of climatechange and adaptation strategies, with a focus on human economic behavior in response to environmental challenges. 
    Her research centers on designing incentive structures in land assembly to ensure that strategies for climate-driven 
    land use changes and displacement are both economically viable and socially just. Yurou aims to provide policymakers 
    with actionable insights to improve the efficiency and equity of policies for land conservation and the relocation of 
    vulnerable communities.

    My research focuses on developing machine learning techniques for challenging problems in sustainability and agriculture. 
    My work has numerous applications including crop yield forecasting, carbon cycle modeling, vegetation monitoring, and detecting fish 
    farms in the Amazon using satellite imagery. I work with experts in agricultural economics, crop science, plant genetics, and ecology,
    to develop innovative AI solutions that can benefit their fields.
