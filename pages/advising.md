Our project ...

Graduate students: I can serve as the main advisor to graduate students in the following fields: Applied Economics and Management, Public Policy, Economics and Natural Resources. These programs have different admissions criteria. The first 3 programs are fully funded for 5+ years and admissions decisions are made by a committee, not by me directly. Applicants for the PhD in Natural Resources generally secure at least some external funding prior to admission (e.g. Fulbright scholarship).

Postdocs: check back soon

Predocs: check back soon
