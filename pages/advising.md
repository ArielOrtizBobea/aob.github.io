**Prospective PhD students:** 

Prof. Ortiz-Bobea can advise graduate students in various academic fields at Cornell: 
- [Applied Economics and Management](https://dyson.cornell.edu/programs/graduate/phd/) (AEM)
- [Public Policy](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/phd/) (PAM)
- [Economics](https://economics.cornell.edu/prospective-incoming-grad-students) (ECON)
- [Natural Resources](https://cals.cornell.edu/natural-resources-environment/degrees-programs/graduate) (NRE) 

These programs have different admissions criteria. Please consult the respective websites for more details.

The first 3 programs (AEM,PAM, ECON) are fully funded and admissions decisions are made by a committee. prof. Ortiz-Bobea does not make admissions decisions directly. Prospective students for the NRE program typically secure some external funding (e.g. Fulbright scholarship) before admission.
