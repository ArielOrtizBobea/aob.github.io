**Prospective PhD students:** 

I can advise graduate students in various academic fields at Cornell: 
- [Applied Economics and Management](https://dyson.cornell.edu/programs/graduate/phd/) (AEM)
- [Public Policy](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/phd/) (PAM)
- [Economics](https://economics.cornell.edu/prospective-incoming-grad-students) (ECON)
- [Natural Resources](https://cals.cornell.edu/natural-resources-environment/degrees-programs/graduate) (NRE) 

These programs have different admissions criteria. Please consult the respective websites for more details.

The first 3 programs (AEM,PAM, ECON) are fully funded and admissions decisions are made by a committee. I do not make admissions decisions directly. You are free to reach out to discuss fit.

Prospective students for the NRE program typically secure some external funding (e.g. Fulbright scholarship) before inquiring about fit and advising.
