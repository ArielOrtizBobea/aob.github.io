**Prospective PhD students:** 

I advise graduate students in various fields at Cornell: 
- [Applied Economics and Management](https://dyson.cornell.edu/programs/graduate/phd/) (AEM)
- [Public Policy](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/phd/) (PAM), 
- [Economics](https://economics.cornell.edu/prospective-incoming-grad-students) (ECON)
- [Natural Resources](https://cals.cornell.edu/natural-resources-environment/degrees-programs/graduate) (NRE). 

These programs have different admissions criteria. 

The first 3 programs (AEM,PAM, ECON) are fully funded and admissions decisions are made by a committee. You are free to reach out and disclose our conversations but I do not make admissions decisions.

Applicants for the NRE program typically secure some external funding before admission (e.g. Fulbright scholarship).
