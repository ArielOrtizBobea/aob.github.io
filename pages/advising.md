**Postdocs:** Coming soon!

**Prospective PhD students:** I can serve as the main advisor to graduate students in the following fields at Cornell: [Applied Economics and Management] (https://dyson.cornell.edu/programs/graduate/phd/) (AEM), [Public Policy]() (PAM), [Economics](https://economics.cornell.edu/prospective-incoming-grad-students) (ECON) and [Natural Resources](https://cals.cornell.edu/natural-resources-environment/degrees-programs/graduate) (NRE). These programs have different admissions criteria. The first 3 programs are fully funded for 5+ years, and admissions decisions are made by a committee, not by me directly. Applicants for the PhD in Natural Resources generally secure at least some external funding before admission (e.g. Fulbright scholarship).

**Predocs:** Coming soon!
