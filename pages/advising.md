Postdocs: Coming soon!

Prospective PhD students: I can serve as the main advisor to graduate students in the following fields at Cornell: Applied Economics and Management (AEM), Public Policy (PAM), Economics (ECON) and Natural Resources (NRE). These programs have different admissions criteria. The first 3 programs are fully funded for 5+ years, and admissions decisions are made by a committee, not by me directly. Applicants for the PhD in Natural Resources generally secure at least some external funding before admission (e.g. Fulbright scholarship).

Predocs: Coming soon!
